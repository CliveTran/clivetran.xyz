# Useful tips that will make your life easier as a developer

Here some tips that I use literally everyday as a Software Engineer:

* ##### Take advantage of ChatGPT whenever you can

    There's no need to talk about this, right? Everyone, especially developers, already know that ChatGPT can answer almost any questions that pop up in your mind. But make sure to double-check because sometimes it can give you incorrect information.

* ##### "Something to something" online converter

    Are you struggling to understand every format that comes across your everyday work to do simple conversions (e.g. XML to JSON, Cron Expression, etc)? I was there too, and the solution is simple, just typing the magic words _"\[something\] to \[something\] online converter"_. It's very likely that there's a tool out there that fits perfectly with your needs and can save you a vast amount of time.

* ##### Make sure to understand things what you do to the very core

    Don't underestimate the importance of fundamental knowledge. Don't just ask "what's the solution for this problem?" You also want to know "why" and "how". What does it bring to the table? How does it actually work? If you can explain complex knowledge to a 5-year-old kid, then you know you have a deep/comprehensive understanding of it.

* ##### Don't live with a broken window

    If something has been done improperly - whether it be bad code or some hack/cheat in the codebase - take action on it ASAP. Don't leave it there and comfort yourself with the _"don't touch it if it works"_ mindset. By doing so, problems will not pile up, and your life will be easier.
