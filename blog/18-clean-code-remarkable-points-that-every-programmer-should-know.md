# 18 Clean code remarkable points that every programmer should know

#### 20 Aug, 2023

&nbsp;

These are some clean code principles distilled from a classic book called **"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"** by **Robert C. Martin**. Here are some remarkable points that I think will benefit us programmers in the long run:

&nbsp;


* ###### 1. Meaningful Names:
   Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, classes, and modules. Names should convey the purpose and intent of the code.

* ###### 2. Functions:
   Keep functions short, with a single responsibility. Functions should do one thing and do it well. Aim for functions that fit within a single screen.

* ###### 3. Comments:
   Strive to write code that is self-explanatory without the need for excessive comments. Comments should be used sparingly and only when necessary to clarify complex parts.

* ###### 4. Formatting:
   Consistent formatting enhances readability. Follow a consistent style for indentation, spacing, and line length. Use vertical spacing to separate related code blocks.

* ###### 5. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   Each class or module should have a single responsibility or reason to change. Avoid creating classes that are responsible for multiple tasks.

* ###### 6. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   Code should be open for extension but closed for modification. Accommodate new features by extending existing code rather than modifying it.

* ###### 7. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):
   Avoid duplicating code. Reuse code through abstraction and encapsulation to eliminate redundancy.

* ###### 8. Small, Focused Classes:
   Create small and focused classes that encapsulate a single concept or functionality. This leads to more modular and maintainable code.

* ###### 9. Testing:
   Write tests that validate the behavior of your code. Automated tests help ensure that changes don't introduce unintended bugs.

* ###### 10. Readable Code:
   Write code that reads like well-written prose. Strive for code that is easy to understand and follow.

* ###### 11. Refactoring:
   Continuously improve the codebase through refactoring. Refactoring involves making small changes to improve code structure without changing its external behavior.

* ###### 12. Code Smells:
   Be aware of common code smells, such as long functions, large classes, and duplicated code. Addressing these issues leads to cleaner code.

* ###### 13. Limit Function Arguments:
   Limit the number of arguments a function takes to enhance its readability and maintainability.

* ###### 14. Dependency Injection:
   Use dependency injection to provide the necessary dependencies to a class rather than having the class create them itself.

* ###### 15. Separation of Concerns:
   Divide your code into separate layers or modules that handle different concerns. This promotes better organization and maintainability.

* ###### 16. Keep It Simple:
   Avoid overengineering and unnecessary complexity. Strive for the simplest solution that meets the requirements.

* ###### 17. Code Review:
   Regularly review code with colleagues to ensure adherence to coding standards and to catch potential issues early.

* ###### 18. Version Control:
   Use version control systems to track and manage changes to your codebase. This aids collaboration and provides a safety net for code changes.
